## Description

This task involves the implementation of a **Singly Linked List** in C.  
It demonstrates key data structure operations including:

- Inserting a new node at the end
- Deleting a node by value
- Displaying the entire linked list

This program uses structures (`struct`) and dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`) to manage the list efficiently.

## Functional Requirements

-  Create and insert nodes at the end
-  Delete a node by value
-  Display the linked list
-  Menu-driven interface
-  Dynamic memory allocation using `malloc`
-  Proper memory freeing using `free`
