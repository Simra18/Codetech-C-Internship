## Description:

This task involves the implementation of a **Singly Linked List** using C programming.It demonstrates essential data structure operations including:

- Inserting a node at the end of the list
- Deleting a node by value
- Displaying the current contents of the linked list

The program uses `struct` definitions and dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`) to manage nodes. It features a **menu-driven interface** allowing users to interactively test linked list operations.

## Functional Requirements:

- Create and insert nodes at the end
- Delete a node by value
- Display all nodes in the list
- Menu-driven user interface
- Dynamic memory handling using `malloc()`
- Proper memory cleanup using `free()`
